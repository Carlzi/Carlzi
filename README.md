## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Carl, 32. Holding a bachelor's degree in finance and mathematics, I worked as a consultant and accountant. 
I'm completing a training at Le Wagon (Paris, FR). Then, I would like to pursue a career as a data analyst within a small company, or to embark on entrepreneurship with an innovative AI solution.
